# React Portfolio

## Description

This early exploration into React refactors my old static portfolio into React's component model.

Utilizing a flexbox layout method simplifies mobile responsiveness for the developer, and mobile responsiveness improves the accessibility of the web application. Creating a portfolio this early into my web development career provides a foundation for future skill application as well as a gallery to demonstrate past work.
