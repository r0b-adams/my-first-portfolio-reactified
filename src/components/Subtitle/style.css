As the portfolio is updated, this file structure
will help to modify individual components

can wrap the whole component in a class and
refer to children components with selectors

in the component file:
<div className="this-component">
    CHILDREN ELEMENTS
<div/>

e.g.

.this-component {
    foo: bar
}

.this-component h1 {
    fizz: buzz
}
